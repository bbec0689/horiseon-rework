# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Project

First I went through and added comments to the HTML so I could better see what was I was working on.
Next I simplified a lot of the class elements so they were easier to type out.
I then corrected the button hrefs so they panned correctly.
Then I changed all of the divs to semantic HTML elements. 
After that I went in and changed all of the classes to what I had changed them into in the index.html.
Then I started by reorganizing the CSS into groups followed by comments that I added to better distinguish the grouped code.
I then went back into the HTML and added alts to all the pictures that needed them.
I then centered the text and matched the color of the blue so that the right and left sides of the page matched to make it more aesthetically pleasing.
After that I fixed the footer and changed the CSS.
Then I formatted the HTML and CSS.
